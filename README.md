**A nice visual rust funsies**

Inspired by [u/houseofleft's post](https://www.reddit.comspiritual /r/proceduralgeneration/comments/o88ual/magnets_generatively_warped_line/). A spiritual successor to [wasm-slime](https://github.com/Exr0nProjects/wasm-slime).

## Running
`npm install` then `npm run start`

I can't figure out how to package and send this over the web..
